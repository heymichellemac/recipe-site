- Makes: ~2.2 litres (about 8 jam jars)
- Prep time: 20 minutes
- Cook time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients
- 1.8kg blackberries
- 1 1/2kg jam sugar
- juice of one lemon
- small knob of butter (optional)

## Method
1. The night before you make your jam, layer the blackberries and sugar together in a very large bowl, then cover and set aside at room temperature. 
2. Before you start, put a small saucer in the freezer.
3. Add the berries to a wide-based pan and stir in lemon juice.
4. Coook on a low heat until all the sugar is dissolved, then bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Turn off the heat and spoon some of the jam onto the chilled saucer. Once it's cool, push it with your finger. If it wrinkles a little, itâ€™s ready and has reached setting point. If it's too runny to wrinkle, return the pan to the heat and boil in 2 or 3-minute stages.
6. Leave the jam for 15 minutes before ladling into sterilised jars. Always ladle the jam into jars while the jars are still warm.
